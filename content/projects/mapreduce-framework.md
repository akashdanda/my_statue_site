Engineered distributed MapReduce system with fault tolerance achieving 2.45x speedup across 3 worker nodes via heartbeat monitoring and automatic task reassignment. Implemented hash-based partitioning to distribute 9M+ key-value pairs across reducers, coordinating map-shuffle-reduce phases via Flask APIs for parallel execution.
